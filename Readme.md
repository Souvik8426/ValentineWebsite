# 💘 Single AF, But Here to Spice Up Your Love Life 💘
**Live Website:** 🌐 [Check it out here](https://valentineforu.netlify.app/) – cuz who needs a date when you've got this? 😏

Hey there, lovebirds (or future lovebirds)! Welcome to **"I’m Single, But Let’s Fix Your Love Life"** – the ultimate Valentine's Day cheat code made by yours truly, a total singleton who's basically a pro at coding but a noob at romance. Think of this as your digital Cupid's arrow: heart-raining animations, cheesy pickup lines, proposal generators, and a timeline of your epic love story. I built this for fun, so let's make Valentine's less awkward and more awesome! 💖✨

## 🌟 What’s This Magical Site Do? (Features Galore!)
- **Heart Rain**: Watch hearts fall like confetti – because why not make it rain love? 🌧️❤️
- **Pickup Lines Generator**: Get those smooth (or hilariously bad) lines to woo your crush. Smooth operator mode: activated! 😘
- **Proposal Pop-Up**: Pop the question in style – with animations that’ll make 'em say yes (hopefully)! 💍

- **Vite**: Super speedy builds, cuz waiting is for bad dates. ⚡
- **TypeScript (TSX)**: Keeps the code from crashing harder than a bad blind date. 🛡️
